## Project Title: Linker

Two-pass linker. Pass One parses the input and verifies the correct syntax and determines the base address, and absolute address. Pass Two uses the base addresses and the symbol table entries created in pass one to generate the output by relocating relative addresses and resolving external references. 

## Project Title: Process_Scheduler

Discrete Event Simuation based process/thread scheduler using multiple algorithms. 

Algorithms used:
* First Come First Serve
* Last Come First Serve
* Shortest Time First
* Round Robin
* Priority

## Project Title: Virtual_Memory_Management

Simualtion of Operating System's Virtual Memory Manager that maps the virtual address spaces of multiple processes onto physical frames using page table translation.

Algorithms used:
* First In First Out (FIFO)
* Clock Page Replacement
* Not Recently Used Page Replacement (NRU)
* Aging
* Working Set

## Project Title: IO_Scheduler

Simulation of scheduling and optimization of I/O operations

Algorithms used:
* First In First Out
* Shortest Seek Time First
* Elevator
* CLOOK
* FLOOK
